## About Me

I'm a 23-year-old from Hungary teaching myself to code while learning digital marketing. My goal is to combine both: build things that not only work, but actually drive results.

- 🔨 **Currently building:** Lexo Chat — a RAG-based chatbot for lead qualification (work in progress)
- 🎯 **Looking for:** My first marketing or technical role in Budapest
- 📚 **Learning:** Advanced GA4 implementation, technical SEO
