## About Me

Self-taught developer from Hungary. No CS degree — just a year of building real projects, shipping them, and learning by doing.

I pick things up fast. I taught myself React and Next.js from scratch, built a tool that got 20k+ views on Reddit in two days, and learned Laravel in a few days for a technical assessment after never touching PHP.

I don't just care about clean code — I care about whether what I build actually moves the needle for the business.

Currently looking for my first developer role.
