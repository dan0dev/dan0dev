## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer who spent the past year intensively building projects and developing real products. I don't just learn to code — I ship market-ready solutions.

I pick things up fast. I taught myself React and Next.js from scratch, built a tool that got 20k+ views on Reddit in two days, and learned Laravel in a few days for a technical assessment after never touching PHP.

I don't just care about clean code — I care about whether what I build actually moves the needle for the business.

Currently looking for my first developer role in Budapest.
