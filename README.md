I'm a self-taught web developer who's super excited about modern frontend tech. Specializing in React ecosystem, including NextJS, Typescript, and UI frameworks like Shadcn UI or Tailwind CSS. Demonstrated ability to build full-stack applications, check one of my favourites **here**. 

Committed to continuous learning and staying current with emerging technologies, particularly interested in AI advancements, Prompt Engineering and backend development. Learning to code has become my favorite thing to do and I'm having a blast building new things. I believe in documenting everything, so expect lots of commits.
